Selenium gives developers the power to control web browsers and use them to automate web application testing. As an open-source toolset, Selenium makes it easier for testers to evaluate web applications without putting in any extra time and effort.


Mastering Selenium Testing Tools is all about demystifying the Selenium suite. Learn to verify web applications, control browsers with code, and scale up the testing environment by distributing the execution of web applications on different browsers running on different operating systems.
